# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Playwrite Louise would like to start a crowd funding campaign to fund her play Fever to raise $10000

## Louise would like us to analyze data to determine likelihood of success or to identify potential barriers to success. 

## Analysis and Challenges
There are many things to consider when starting a Kickstarter campaign.
*The strength of the economy
*Trends in the industry that may lead one category to be in favor over another during Kickstarter campaigns
*Goals and expectations of those launching the Kickstarter campaigns

### The Kickstarter Trend by industry
Based on the year over year successful launch chart below, you can see the health of Kickstarters for each category year over year.  By looking at the data one can see:
* Music and publishing Kickstarters are showing a steady downward trend
* Film, video and technology kick starter tend to show healthier success rates than games and food
* Theater Kickstarts show very strong activity year over year,especially during years 2014 - 2016  This is information is favorable for a launch of a theater kickstart campaign.  Especially for a play as the next two plots show.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From date ranges provided in the spreadsheet, 2009-2017, Kickstarters have proven to be a very popular method to generate money to fund projects.  Over 4000 Kickstarter campaigns were iniated over this time frame.  By analyzing Kickstarter data for all categoriesk, May appears to be the best time to launch a kickstart campain.

To provide further clarity we can continue to drill further into the Kickstarter data by providing information based solely on the category of interest which is funding for Theater.  Based on this information, one can see that it is more evident that the month of May is the best month to launch a successful Kickstart campaign. Please see attached Image.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As mentioned previoulsy, goals and expectations play an important role with regards to the success of a Kickstart campaign. The goal should be set at a value that market is willing and able to support. Setting a goal that exceeds the limit of the market will almost ensure failure and may even deter donations to fund.  By reviewing the table below of successful and failed theater/play kickstarters, the Mean and Median goals of successful campaigns were almost less that half of the Mean and Median of the failed campaign goals.  One step further, the failed campaign pledges would have not met the goals of the levels set by the successful campaigns.  The reasoning of why the failed campaigns pleadges were so low would need further investigation.  By reviewing the Goals and Pledges of the successful campaign the mean and upper and lower quartile numbers were similar while the failed campaigns goals and pledges were significantly lower than the upper and lower quartiles.
